Shotgun change sync daemon

Largely copied from P4 example change review daemon from here:
 http://public.perforce.com/wiki/P4Review

If run directly with the <repeat> configuration variable = 1, the script
will sleep for "sleeptime" seconds and then run again.  On UNIX you can
run the script from cron by setting <repeat> = 0 and adding the following
line to the cron table with "crontab -e:"

       * * * * * /path/to/shotgun_revision_create.py

This will run the script every minute.  Note that if you use cron you
should be sure that the script will complete within the time allotted.

The CONFIGURATION VARIABLES below should be examined and in some
cases changed.
